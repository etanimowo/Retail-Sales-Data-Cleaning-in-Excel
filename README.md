### Project Overview
This project focused on cleaning a retail sales dataset with over 5,000 records using Microsoft Excel. The data contained common issues such as missing values, inconsistent formatting, duplicates, and invalid entries.

### Objective
The goal of this project was to clean and prepare a messy dataset of retail transactions containing over 5,000 rows. The retail dataset had issues such as missing values, inconsistent formats, duplicated entries, and incorrect data types. I used Microsoft Excel to clean and standardize the data to make it ready for analysis.

### Data Source
The dataset used for this project was gotten from a retail shop – (dirty_retail_dataset.xlsx). It consisted of over 5,000 rows representing customer name, email, purchase date, product, quantity, price, and city.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Excel functions: PROPER(), DATEVALUE()
- Data Validation, Filters, Remove Duplicates, and Conditional Formatting

### Initial Assessment
The first step in any data cleaning project is to have a proper understand of the dataset being worked upon.  Therefore, I began the data cleaning by opening the retail dataset and scanning through the columns: Customer Name, Email, Purchase Date, Product, Quantity, Price, and City to gain clarity and after careful observation. I observed several issues like:
- Missing values in Email, Quantity, and Price columns.
- Inconsistent date formats and invalid placeholders like “N/A”.
- Product names with inconsistent capitalization and spelling variations.
- Duplicate records.
- City names with inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "philadelphia" vs. "Philadelphia").
